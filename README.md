# Easy-BASH-Scripts
A collection of BASH scripts that install various software on Debian/Ubuntu based Linux distros.

## How to use  
Download the script you need then set permissions. Probably best to create a folder for the scripts, also.  
```
# Create folder
mkdir bash-scripts && cd bash-scripts
# Download script
wget https://github.com/dazeb/Easy-BASH-Scripts/blob/main/docker-stack-install.sh
# Set Permissions
chmod +x docker-stack-install.sh
# Run the script
sh docker-stack-install.sh
```
